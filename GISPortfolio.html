		<h3>Flammulated Owl Site Suitability Analysis</h3>
			<p>As a final project for a university GIS course, I was tasked with determining the ideal locations for survey locations to spot the flammulated owl within Yosemite National Park, California.<br>
			Research shows that these owls primarily breed in low-to-mid-elevation montane forests with moderate levels of canopy closure.  Forests dominated by Ponderosa Pines are preferred breeding locations, though flammulated owls have also been found to breed in Douglas fir forests and, to a lesser degree, Lodgepole pines and other conifers.  There is also evidence of these owls preferring stands on moderately sloping terrain, as well as ridgetops, particularly sites with east or south facing slopes.<br>
			These attributes defining breeding location of the flammulated owls were grouped together into a site suitability model, with numeric ranks being applied to different variables, namely elevation, TPI(topographical position index), aspect, vegetation type, cover percentage, and distance to roads or trails.<br>
			Utilizing multiple datasets of Yosemite National Park, such as maps of vegetation type and elevation, I identified regions of the park suitable for flammulated owl breeding sites, shown in the two maps below.</p>
