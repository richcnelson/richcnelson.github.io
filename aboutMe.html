		<h1>About Me</h1>
		<p>A recent Planetary Sciences graduate from UC Santa Cruz, I am a driven, hard-working individual, eager to put my skills to use in the professional world.  In my free time, I enjoy hiking, travel, and making music.  Currently living near Sacramento, I'm willing to relocate for work, but would be open to positions in the Sacramento area as well.</p>
